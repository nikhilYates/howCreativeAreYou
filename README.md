Bunch of scripts to make cool ish (that surve a purpose of course)

ASCII art, neural network (resembling) art. 

1. ascii.py takes a black and white jpg of any image and generates ascii art. I used a small character-density oriented array of letters, numbers, and symbols. Used in a faculty presentation at York
2. nodeArt.py creates a black opencv image, populates it with nodes and connects the lines. I wanted to create my own NN art for the same faculty presentation at York (I'll link the slides PDF once finish the report)
3. nodeArtII.py looks to combine the previous two programs. Essentially, I want to take a black and white image, and populate the black outline with nodes. Then, connect these nodes using an algorithm I developed in a robotics class using a custom RRT algorithm.

No, it's not that I have an abundance of time. I just like this shit.
